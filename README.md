## Introduction
This repository showcasing my traffic accident data analysis project completed during my data science internship at Prodigy Infotech. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving insights from a dataset comprising traffic accident records. Explore the repository to delve into the world of data-driven insights from traffic accidents.

## Dataset
This <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents">dataset</a> encompasses car accidents across 49 states of the USA spanning from February 2016 to March 2023. It comprises approximately 7.7 million accident records sourced from a variety of entities such as transportation departments, law enforcement agencies, cameras, and traffic sensors. The project aims to analyze this extensive dataset to unveil insights into accident patterns, identify hotspots, and suggest measures to enhance road safety.

## Task Description
This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of car accidents in 49 states of the USA from February 2016 to March 2023. With approximately 7.7 million accident records collected from diverse sources including transportation departments, law enforcement agencies, cameras, and traffic sensors, the goal is to conduct data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and derive actionable insights. The primary objectives include:

- Identify patterns and trends in the accident data.
- Locate accident hotspots within the dataset.
- Provide recommendations for improving road safety based on the insights gained from the analysis.

## Key Findings

- **City-wise Distribution**: Miami records the highest number of accidents, with Star Junction and Stromsburg having the least occurrences.
- **State-wise Distribution**: California leads in the number of accidents, while South Dakota has the lowest.
- **Yearly Trends**: 2021 witnessed the highest number of accidents.
- **Severity Levels**: The majority of accidents were classified at severity level 2.
- **Weather Conditions**: Most accidents took place under fair weather conditions.
- **Time of Day**: The morning hours saw the highest frequency of accidents.

## Conclusion
The examination of traffic accident data reveals notable patterns, including elevated accident rates in densely populated regions like Miami and California. A substantial portion of accidents takes place during fair weather conditions in the morning. These findings offer valuable insights for guiding road safety initiatives and policy-making endeavors aimed at decreasing accidents and enhancing public safety
